The chicken door roller.  Many people ask what I do if the chickens are still in the doorway when it starts closing, thinking that the door moves drops like a rocket and might decapitate said chicken.  However, the gearing of the motor is so high that the door takes a full 37 seconds to close.  Besides, you should see how fast chickens can move when they're startled.
